# Zeta Framework

This is a simple framework in C++ for developing 2D games. It currently supports Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.

You can find it being put to use in my in-development game [Kaōzeth](https://github.com/harrisonkwhite/kaozeth).

## Building

Clone the repository by running `git clone --recursive https://github.com/harrisonkwhite/zeta_framework.git`.

> **Note:** If the repository was cloned non-recursively before, just run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to clone the necessary submodules.

Then go into the repository root and build with CMake:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

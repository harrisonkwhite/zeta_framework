# Zeta Framework

This is a simple framework in C for developing 2D games using OpenGL.

You can find it being put to use in my [clone of Terraria](https://github.com/harrisonkwhite/terraria_clone).

Please note that I made this primarily for learning purposes and for personal use. If you want to make your own games in C, I would highly recommend instead using the more substantial [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).

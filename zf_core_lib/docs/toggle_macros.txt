ZCL_ENABLE_NO_BOUNDS_CHECKING_IN_RELEASE:
By default, in both debug AND release mode the ZCL array indexing operations have bounds checking and will trigger a fatal error on violation.
If you don't want the performance cost, define this and there'll be no checking at all IN RELEASE MODE. In debug mode, the checking is still done via asserts.

Tomorrow:
- RNG system needs mix function and seed should influence stream.
- Start on basic music streaming



- Subnamespaces are kind of annoying for the user and don't add that much value I don't think.

- Maybe be more consistent about how templates are used for t_f32 and t_f64
- Properly check correctness of packed asset binary files
- Validation barriers need to be made more clear. Make sure validity for colours, origins, alignment, rectangles, etc. are in place. Only worry about reasonable things.
- Make sure the licensing is all fine. Check whether BGFX license is needed in game dist.
- Properly check for correctness in deserialization and unpacking ops.
- Basic music streaming system at the very least
- Fill out tests

There are a handful of comments marked with "@todo" throughout the codebase that need to be addressed as well.

Nice to have:
- Stack and queue DS
- Music layering and management.
- Text rotation and scaling
- A* pathfinding utilities.
- Helpers for drawing circles and polygons
- More built-in shaders
- Priority queue DS

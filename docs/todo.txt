- Might need to revisit some of the basic error stuff.
- Stack frame in release is not very useful
- Clean up includes all across project
- Some kind of sound group system like what's in gamemaker, so groups of sounds can share the same volume for instance
- String streams
- Make sure references are used consistently and correctly.

- Maybe be more consistent about how templates are used for t_f32 and t_f64. Also integrals
- Properly check correctness of built asset binary files
- Validation barriers need to be made more clear. Make sure validity for colours, origins, alignment, rectangles, etc. are in place. Only worry about reasonable things.
- Make sure the licensing is all fine. Check whether BGFX license is needed in game dist.
- Properly check for correctness in deserialization ops.
- Fill out tests

There are a handful of comments marked with "@todo" throughout the codebase that need to be addressed as well.

Nice to have:
- Stack and queue DS
- A* pathfinding utilities.
- Helpers for drawing circles and polygons
- More built-in shaders
- Priority queue DS

- Change raw to external

Input being global? Then you'd lose the clean system of handling input events. It becomes entirely possible to process input events during render phase. This is very bad for the text input.


Global input pros and cons:

Pros:
- In the game you don't have to pass around input state everywhere

Cons:
- Less testability
- Less clear state control and movement (no const control)



Explicit input state but only once pros and cons:

Pros:
- More consistency
- Input API usage more obvious

Cons:
- Misleading API
- Less testability



Audio pros and cons:

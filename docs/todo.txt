- Make sure the licensing is all fine. Check whether BGFX license is needed in game dist.
- Properly check for correctness in deserialization and unpacking ops.
- Get a frame rendered before showing the window. I hate the white screen on startup.
- Ability to change target FPS mid-game.
- Ability to get debug info like FPS.
- Ability to change background clear color.
- RNG system needs mix function and seed should influence stream.
- Bring back polygon code
- Basic music streaming system at the very least
- Unicode text input handling
- Fill out tests
- Assets won't get updated unless a recompile is triggered - this is annoying!

There are a handful of comments marked with "@todo" throughout the codebase that need to be addressed as well.

Nice to have:
- Static list DS
- Dynamic list DS
- Queue DS
- Music layering and management.
- Text rotation and scaling
- A* pathfinding utilities.
- Helpers for drawing circles and polygons
- More built-in shaders
- Priority queue DS

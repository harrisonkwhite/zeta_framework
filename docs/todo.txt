- t_len usage is inconsistent and probably overdone. Replace everywhere with t_i32.
- Create a really tight model for SURFACE shader program validation. Check that all necessary uniforms and so on are there.
- Ability to change target FPS mid-game.
- Ability to get debug info like FPS.
- RNG system.
- Gamepad support.
- Bring back polygon code
- Basic music streaming system at the very least

There are a handful of comments marked with "@todo" throughout the codebase that need to be addressed as well.

Nice to have:
- Dynamic list DS
- Queue DS
- Music layering and management.
- Text rotation and scaling
- A* pathfinding utilities.
- Helpers for drawing circles and polygons
- More built-in shaders
- Priority queue DS

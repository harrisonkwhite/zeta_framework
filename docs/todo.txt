- There are surely cases where ZCL_FATAL can be preceded with a custom case-specific error log
    - Can probably remove ZCL_REQUIRE while at it, more complexity than needed
- Need to be able to render multiple string lines
- Blend is overloaded term in rendering code
generally speaking, need some ability static assert on static array length! This is a VERY USEFUL feature!
- Try to minimise the STL includes in basic, or consider a PCH. Also cmath ideally shouldnt be included
- Could a static string type be useful?
- The asset packer seems to fail randomly on certain assets sometimes??
- Activity array could be useful considering how often I need it perosnally
- Be more consistent about cases where rectangles with negative sizes are valid - they exist
- There should be a consistent notion of "backbuffer size" or "window size" shared between both rendering context and tick context. It's too much of a mess right now.
- Helpers for polygon drawing
- Debug services, ability to see how long last frame took not just FPS
- Would be really good for the global modules to be able to capture a state snapshot in the form of a struct and then reproduce the module state from that struct. Makes testing easier.
- Be more consistent about when REQUIRE is used instead of ASSERT

- Could be an idea to have a macro e.g. ZCL_UNSAFE that basically has array out-of-bounds checking non-fatal
- Documentation sucks man
- Might need to revisit some of the basic error stuff.
- Clean up includes all across project
- Some kind of sound group system like what's in gamemaker, so groups of sounds can share the same volume for instance
- Make sure references are used consistently and correctly.

- Maybe be more consistent about how templates are used for t_f32 and t_f64. Also integrals
- Properly check correctness of built asset binary files
- Validation barriers need to be made more clear. Make sure validity for colours, origins, alignment, rectangles, etc. are in place. Only worry about reasonable things.
- Make sure the licensing is all fine. Check whether BGFX license is needed in game dist.
- Properly check for correctness in deserialization ops.
- Fill out tests

There are a handful of comments marked with "@todo" throughout the codebase that need to be addressed as well.

Nice to have:
- Stack and queue DS
- A* pathfinding utilities.
- Helpers for drawing circles and polygons
- More built-in shaders
- Priority queue DS

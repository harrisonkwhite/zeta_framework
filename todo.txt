- Window and graphics code should be the same module. Input should be a distinct module from these two.
- The asset packer should allow you to create font asset files which include non-ASCII symbols. The extra symbols could be sourced from some text file (e.g. all the dialogue in a game) and any symbol that ever occurs there needs to be supported (duplicates allowed). Alternatively, you could specify a list of unicode symbol ranges in the packing instructions JSON file. An error or warning should be given if the font itself does not support a specific requested symbol.
- Set up UTF-8 string handling.
- Set up rendering of UTF-8 strings. Symbols and associated data (e.g. location in atlas, alignment data) should be put into an unordered map.
- Maybe have a simple wrapper around raw pointers to trip assert on null dereference?
- Support music playing and flexibility over things like volume control.
- Rework and extend RNG system - it sucks. Refrain from using global state for it.
- Figure out how to implement surfaces, bypassing the issues with transparency.

Big-picture things that this framework needs by the end of the year:
- Consider whether to use generic allocators.
- Switch to linked block approach for the hash map.
- Togglable debug overlays with FPS and so on, use some built-in font.
- Convert enums to enum classes, use operator overloading if needed.
- Helpers for 2D arrays.
- Non-ASCII font loading and text rendering.
- RNG system overhaul.
- Music layering and management.
- Surfaces.
- Window and graphics code should be the same module. Input should be a distinct module from these two.
- A* pathfinding utilities.
- Gamepad support.
- MAYBE utilities for sprites and animation, but this could be project-specific.
- MAYBE have more built-in shaders for surfaces, consider putting them in different files and using the zf_bin_to_array tool.
- Run proper testing on everything, these tests should be PUBLIC.

There are a handful of comments marked with "@todo" throughout the codebase that need to be addressed as well.

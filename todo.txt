- The asset packer should allow you to create font asset files which include non-ASCII symbols. The extra symbols could be sourced from some text file (e.g. all the dialogue in a game) and any symbol that ever occurs there needs to be supported (duplicates allowed). Alternatively, you could specify a list of unicode symbol ranges in the packing instructions JSON file. An error or warning should be given if the font itself does not support a specific requested symbol.
- Set up UTF-8 string handling.
- Set up rendering of UTF-8 strings. Symbols and associated data (e.g. location in atlas, alignment data) should be put into an unordered map.
- Maybe have a simple wrapper around raw pointers to trip assert on null dereference?
- Set up iterators.
- Support sound playing.
- Support music playing and flexibility over things like volume control.
- Rework and extend RNG system - it sucks. Refrain from using global state for it.
- Figure out how to implement surfaces, bypassing the issues with transparency.

There are a handful of comments marked with "@todo" throughout the codebase that need to be addressed as well.

- Better error indication in font loading.
- MAYBE write a code correctness checker tool. This can make sure prefixes are correct, structs are all trivially constructible, there are no parameter name discrepencies between declaration and definition, etc.
- Bit code needs a lot more helpers for things like rotation, masking, etc.
- Consider whether to allow leaks in the case of intermediate failure.
- Switch to linked block approach for the hash map.
- Togglable debug overlays with FPS and so on, use some built-in font.
- Non-ASCII font loading and text rendering.
- RNG system overhaul.
- Music layering and management.
- Surfaces.
- Window and graphics code should be the same module. Input should be a distinct module from these two.
- A* pathfinding utilities.
- Gamepad support.
- Run proper testing on everything, these tests should be PUBLIC.
- MAYBE utilities for sprites and animation, but this could be project-specific.
- MAYBE have more built-in shaders for surfaces, consider putting them in different files and using the zf_bin_to_array tool.
- MAYBE use STL type traits, not custom ones. Add safety checking for arena push.

There are a handful of comments marked with "@todo" throughout the codebase that need to be addressed as well.

Fonts, specifically:
- Clean up string code, split between ASCII and UTF-8.
- Add kerning support. Also clean up kerning setup code.
- Add text alignment.
- Add text colouring, scaling (yes), and rotation.
- Add function for generating string collider.
- TEST!
